# Vending Machine

# INTRODUCTIONS
This is a CLI program that emulates a vending machine. Users can "feed" money into their account to purchase
goods from a display of items. The machine is stocked by reading a text file and the current inventory is
updated as users make purchases. At the end, users will receive their change. Purchases are logged in a
separate text file for auditing purposes and a "hidden" menu option can be used to generate a sales report.
