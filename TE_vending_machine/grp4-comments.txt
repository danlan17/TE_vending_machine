1. Code is super clean and well organized with good use
of inheritances, packages, and well encapsulated methods.

2. The feature to press a number to exit out of option 1 (display items)
seems like an odd design choice:

ENTER A NUMBER TO RETURN TO MAIN MENU

Please choose an option >>> 

But seriously, almost nothing to complain about, great job!
